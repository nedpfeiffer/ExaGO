\section{Formulation}
The multi-period optimal power flow problem is a series of optimal power flow problems coupled via temporal constraints. The generator real power deviation ($p_{jt}^{\text{g}} - p_{jt-\Delta{t}}^{\text{g}}$) constrained within the ramp limits form the temporal constraints. An illustration of the temporal constraints is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tcopflow} with four time steps. Each time-step $t$ is coupled with its preceding time $t-\Delta{t}$, where $\Delta{t}$ is the time-step where the objective is to find a least cost dispatch for the given time horizon.

In general form, the equations for multi-period optimal power flow are given by
(\ref{eq:tcopflow_start}) -- (\ref{eq:tcopflow_end}). TCOPFLOW solves to minimize the total generation cost $\sum_{t=0}^{N_t-1}f(x_t)$ over the time horizon, where $N_t$ is the number of time-steps. At each time-step, the equality constraints ($g(x_t)$), inequality $h(x_t)$, and the lower/upper limit ($x^-$,$x^+$) constraints need to be satisfied. Equation (\ref{eq:tcopflow_end}) represents the coupling between the consecutive time-steps. It is a most common form of coupling that limits the deviation of the real power generation at time $t$ from its preceding time-step $t-\Delta{t}$ to within its ramping capability $\delta_t{x}$.

\section{Input and Output}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network file:} The network file describing the network details. Only \matpower format files are currently supported.
    \item \textbf{Load data:} One file for load real power and one fo reactive power. The files need to be in CSV format. An example of the format for the 9-bus case is \href{https://gitlab.pnnl.gov/exasgd/frameworks/exago/-/tree/master/datafiles/case9}{here}.
    \item \textbf{Wind generation:} The wind generation time-series described in CSV format. See an example of the format \href{https://gitlab.pnnl.gov/exasgd/frameworks/exago/-/tree/master/datafiles/case9}{here}.
\end{itemize}


The \tcopflow output is saved to a directory named \emph{tcopflowout}. This directory contains $N_t$ files, one for each time-step, in \matpower data file format.
