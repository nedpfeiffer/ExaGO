\chapter{Security-constrained optimal power flow (\scopflow)}\label{chap:scopflow}
SCOPFLOW solves a contingency-constrained optimal power flow problem. The problem is set up as a two-stage optimization problem where the first-stage (base-case) represents the normal operation of the grid and the second-stage comprises of $N_c$ contingency scenarios. Each contingency scenario can be single or multi-period.

\section{Formulation}

\subsection{Single-period}

The contingency-constrained optimal power flow (popularly termed as security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) in power system parlance) attempts to find a least cost dispatch for the base case (or no contingency) while ensuring that if any of contingencies do occur then the system will be secure. This is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:scopflow} for a SCOPF with a base-case $c_0$ and three contingencies.

\input{figures/scopflow_fig.tex}


In general form, the equations for contingency-constrained optimal power flow are given by
(\ref{eq:scopflow_start}) -- (\ref{eq:scopflow_end}). This is a two-stage stochastic optimization problem where the first stage is the base case $c_0$ and each of the contingency states $c_i, i \in [1,N_c-1]$ are second-stage subproblems. SCOPF aims to minimize the objective for the base case $f(x_0)$, while adhering to the equality ($g(x_c)$), inequality $h(x_c)$, and the lower/upper bound ($x^-$,$x^+$) constraints. Equation (\ref{eq:scopflow_end}) represents the coupling between the base-case and each of the contingency states $c_i$. Equation (\ref{eq:scopflow_end}) is the most typical form of coupling that limits the deviation of the contingency variables $x_c$ from the base $x_0$ to within $\delta_c{x}$. An example of this constraint could be the allowed real power output deviation for the generators constrained by their ramp limit.


\begin{align}
\centering
\text{min}&~f(x_0)&  \label{eq:scopflow_start}\\
&\text{s.t.}& \nonumber \\
&~g(x_c) = 0,                             &c \in \left[0,N_c-1\right]& \\
&~h(x_c) \le 0,                           &c \in \left[0,N_c-1\right]& \\
x^- & \le x_c \le x^+,                     &c\in \left[0,N_c-1\right]& \\
-\delta_c{x} & \le x_c - x_0 \le \delta_c{x},&c \in \left[1,N_c\right]&
\label{eq:scopflow_end}
\end{align}

\subsection{Multiperiod}

In the multi-period version,each contingency comprises of multiple time-periods. The multiple periods have variables and constraints as described in chapter \ref{chap:tcopflow}. An example of multi-contingency multi-period optimal power flow is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:ctopflow} with two contingencies $c_0$ and $c_1$. Here, $c_0$ is the case with no contingencies, i.e., the base-case. Each contingency is multi-period with four time-periods. Each time-step is coupled with its adjacent one through ramping constraints. We assume that the contingency is incident at the first time-step, i.e. at $t_0$. This results in the coupling between the contingency cases $c_i, i \in [1,N_c-1]$ and the base-case $c_0$ only at time-step $t_0$ as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ctopflow}.

\input{figures/ctopflow_fig}

The overall objective of this contingency-constrained multi-period optimal power flow is to find a secure dispatch for base-case $c_0$ while adhering to contingency and temporal constraints. Its general formulation is given in Eqs. (\ref{eq:ctopflow_start}) -- (\ref{eq:ctopflow_end}).

\begin{align}
\centering
\text{min}&~\sum_{t=0}^{N_t-1}f(x_{0,t})&  \label{eq:ctopflow_start}\\
&\text{s.t.}& \nonumber \\
&~g(x_{c,t}) = 0,                                        &c \in \left[0,N_c-1\right], t \in \left[0,N_t-1\right]& \\
&~h(x_{c,t}) \le 0,                                      &c \in \left[0,N_c-1\right], t \in \left[0,N_t-1\right]& \\
x^- & \le x_{c,t} \le x^+,                               &c \in \left[0,N_c-1\right], t\in \left[0,N_t-1\right]& \\
-\delta_t{x} & \le x_{c,t} - x_{c,t-\Delta{t}} \le \delta_t{x},&c \in \left[0,N_c-1\right], t \in \left[1,N_t-1\right]& \label{eq:ctopflow_time_coupling}\\
-\delta_c{x} & \le x_{c,0} - x_{0,0} \le \delta_c{x},&c \in \left[1,N_c-1\right]& \\
\label{eq:ctopflow_end}
\end{align}

In this formulation, the objective is to reduce the cost for the base-case time horizon, where $f(x_{0,t})$ is the objective cost for contingency $c_0$ at time $t$. Equation (\ref{eq:ctopflow_end}) represents the coupling between the base case $c_0$ and each contingency $c_i$ at time-step $t_0$. We use a simple box constraint $\delta_c{x}$ to restrict the  deviation of decision variables $x_{c,0}$ from the base-case $x_{0,0}$. The bound $\delta_c{x}$ could represent here, for example, the allowable reserve for each generator.

\section{Input and Output}
To execute SCOPFLOW, the following files are required:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network file:} The network file describing the network details. Only \matpower format files are currently supported.
    \item \textbf{Contingency file:} The file describing the contingencies. Contingencies can be single or multiple outages. The contingency file needs to be described in PTI format.
\end{itemize}
If the multi-period option is chosen, then additional files describing the load and wind generation can be (optionally) set.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Load data:} One file for load real power and one fo reactive power. The files need to be in CSV format. An example of the format for the 9-bus case is \href{https://gitlab.pnnl.gov/exasgd/frameworks/exago/-/tree/master/datafiles/case9}{here}.
    \item \textbf{Wind generation:} The wind generation time-series described in CSV format. See an example of the format \href{https://gitlab.pnnl.gov/exasgd/frameworks/exago/-/tree/master/datafiles/case9}{here}.
\end{itemize}

The \scopflow output is saved to a directory named \emph{scopflowout}. This directory contains $N_c$ files to save the solution for each contingency in MATPOWER datafile format. Each file has the name \emph{cont_xx} where \emph{xx} is the contingency number. 

If multi-period option is chosen then $N_c$ subdirectories are created (one for each contingency), and each subdirectory contains $N_t$ output files, one for each time-period. The subdirectories have the naming convention \emph{cont_xx} and the output file are named as \emph{t_yy} where \emph{yy} is the time-step number.


\section{Solvers}
\scopflow can be solved with \ipopt. If one wants to solve each contingency independently, i.e., without any coupling constraints then use \emph{EMPAR} solver. \emph{EMPAR} distributes the contingencies to different processes when executed in parallel.

\section{Options}

Depending on the \emph{mode}, SCOPFLOW can either be \emph{preventive} (mode = 0) or \emph{corrective} (mode = 1). In the preventive mode, the PV and PQ generator real power is fixed to its corresponding base-case values. The generators at the referencce bus pick up any make-up power required for the contingency. The corrective mode allows deviation of the PV and PQ generator real power from the base-case dispatch constrained by its 30-min. ramp rate capability.
