abstract = {This paper describes a new methodology for three-phase electrical system optimization, in which the phase unbalances are to be taken into account. A formulation for the three-phase optimal power-flow solution was developed using the primal-dual interior point method and the three-phase current injection method in rectangular coordinates. The Hessian matrix has a 6×6 blocked structure, where most of the elements are constant or equal to zero during the solution process. This characteristic brings computational efficiency when applied to three-phase systems. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Liu2017,
abstract = {Conventionally, power system has a hierarchical control structure including primary, secondary, and tertiary controls. The drawbacks of this hierarchical scheme are manifest: 1) it lacks flexibility and scalability, which is against the trend toward an open-access power system; 2) load forecast as the basis of tertiary control could be inaccurate and infeasible, especially in microgrid for example; 3) as the penetration of renewable energy increases, the relatively long time-scales of secondary and tertiary controls cannot accommodate to more severe power fluctuation within the system. To avoid these drawbacks, a distributed real-time optimal power flow control strategy is introduced in this paper. With the aid of up-to-date smart grid technologies such as two-way communication and distributed sensor, the proposed approach can avoid the need of load forecast and achieve the same objective as hierarchical control with a feedback mechanism in real time, that is to recover the nominal system frequency and maintain the active power of the generators close to the optimal operational condition in the presence of any disturbance. Convergence of the proposed approach is analytically proved. Simulation results in a 34-bus islanded microgrid and the IEEE 118-bus bulk power grid validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

@article{Velloso2019,
abstract = {In this paper, we present decomposition techniques for solving large-scale instances of the security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problem with primary response. Specifically, under each contingency state, we require that the nodal demands are met and that the synchronized units generating below their limits follow a linear model for primary response. The resulting formulation is a mixed-integer linear program since the primary response model introduces disjunctions to the SCOPF problem. Unfortunately, exact methods relying on traditional Benders' decomposition do not scale well. As an alternative, we propose a decomposition scheme based on the column-and-constraint-generation algorithm where we iteratively add disjunctions and cuts. We provide procedures for preprocessing dedicated cuts and for numerically determining the post-contingency responses based on the master problem solutions. We also discuss heuristics to generate high-quality primal solutions and upper bounds for the method. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method on large-scale systems.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present the potential of Optimal Power Flow (OPF) as a planning rather than operating tool. First a method for determining network headroom is briefly described. The key point is the modeling of new generators and interconnections to external grids as the outputs of virtual generators connected at respective points on the network. OPF then determines their output, which represents size of new capacity or volume of imports/exports, by maximizing the benefit for the network operator from expected energy exports and the ability of the network to absorb new generation capacity. The methodology is expanded in order to consider constraints imposed by existing switchgear and the impact of voltage control policies on capacity allocation, as examples of the adaptability of the suggested approach to future planning conditions. Furthermore, sensitivity by-products attached to the OPF constraints during the solution process can signal the optimal reinforcement options. The overall approach is demonstrated using a 12-bus meshed network. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

All the transmission and generation limits are respected during both the pre- and post-contingency states without relying on post-contingency redispatch. Therefore, all credible generation contingencies should be modeled in PSCOPF and the system-wide automatic primary response should be allocated accordingly among synchronized generators by adjusting their droop coefficients. This paper proposes a new PSCOPF model that optimizes the droop coefficients of the synchronized generators. The cost savings attained with the proposed approach and its computational performance are evaluated.

The proposed method builds on a chance-constrained multi-period AC OPF formulation, where probabilistic constraints are utilized to enforce voltage regulation with a prescribed probability. To enable a computationally affordable solution approach, a convex reformulation of the OPF task is obtained by resorting to i) suitable linear approximations of the power flow equations, and ii) convex approximations of the chance constraints. Particularly, the approximate chance constraints provide conservative bounds that hold for arbitrary distributions of the forecasting errors. An adaptive optimization strategy is then obtained by embedding the proposed OPF task into a model predictive control framework.},

Optimal power flow (OPF) is a powerful tool for determining the optimal control variables of a power system, where considering the uncertainties is increasingly important. This paper presents an efficient approach to address the uncertain factors arisen by load demand and renewable generation in power system, via a robust security constrained-optimal power flow (SCOPF) model. The proposed approach consists of two steps. First, a robust OPF is realized through a minimum number of uncertainty scenarios selected from TOAT method. Then, the security constraints are incorporated into the robust OPF through Benders decomposition. The obtained solution is robust against uncertain variables and secure against contingencies, meanwhile with high degree of scalability.},

The Spanish power system considers the pool-based daily market and the technical constraints resolution as two different and consecutive processes.

In this paper, an algorithm based on Benders decomposition, arranged in three levels, is proposed to solve the technical constraints solution process in order to define a preventive secure dispatch. The constraints resolution process includes a full ac network and security model. This method determines the active power committed to each generating unit so as to minimize the energy redispatch cost subject to dispatch, network, and security constraints. The solution also provides the reactive power output of the generating units, the value of the transformers taps, and the committed voltage control devices.

abstract = {This paper examines three different formulations of AC optimal power flow problem and compares performance of well-established general-purpose optimization algorithms for each, over different initial conditions. Polar power-voltage, rectangular power-voltage, and rectangular current-voltage are formulated to evaluate ACOPF solution characteristic. The formulation here maintains line flows as explicit variables and employs summations of these quantities to impose conservation conditions at each node. Two representations of line thermal limits are considered, one using real power (to allow comparisons to dc power flow approximations), and a more physically based ampacity limit using current magnitude. Nonlinear generator capability curves are represented ("D-curves"), including options to allow active and reactive limits dependent on generator voltage. A uniform objective function is used throughout, that of minimizing quadratic generator operating cost curves. Numerical performance case studies are performed for these formulations over six different classes of initial conditions, evaluating computational time and also robustness of convergence.},

Our main contributions are the introduction of systematic methods to obtain zero relaxation gap, providing a tractable chance constrained SCOPF formulation, and addressing scalability. We introduce a systematic procedure to obtain zero relaxation gap using a penalty term on power losses. To achieve tractability of the joint chance constraint, a piecewise affine approximation, and a combination of randomized and robust optimization is used. To address scalability, we propose an iterative solution algorithm to identify binding constraints, and we apply a chordal decomposition of the semidefinite constraints.

abstract = {With the increasing integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) in the power grid, a decentralized approach becomes essential for scheduling and allocation of resources in a smart grid. Economic Dispatch (ED) and Unit Commitment (UC) are the two major resource allocation problems that play critical role in the safe and stable operation of a grid system. The uncertainty associated with renewable energy sources have made the resource allocation problems even more challenging for grid operators. The future grid will have a higher generation mix of renewable energy sources and a large load of Electrical vehicles, with the possibility of bi-directional power flow. This complex smart grid system necessitates the development of a decentralized approach to resource allocation problem, which allows inter-node communication and decision making. Multi-agent systems (MAS) is a promising platform to decentralize the traditional centralized resource allocation aspects of smart grid. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on the application of MAS to Economic Dispatch (ED) and Unit Commitment (UC) in smart grids.},

A decomposed security-constrained optimal power flow is developed to demonstrate the significant speed enhancement of the chosen algorithm. The risk-based optimal power flow, risk-based unit commitment problem, risk-based transmission line expansion, and risk-based Var resource allocation are formulated and demonstrated.

abstract = {Realistic representations of contingencies in AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) often challenge traditional bus-branch network models. Derived from nodal analysis, such approaches represent network constraints in terms of the familiar bus admittance matrix, Ybus. A fixed Ybus is unable to represent common circuit breaker actions such as bus splitting. Work-arounds for Ybus-based analysis typically rely on topology processing, switching between different Ybus matrices depending on breaker settings. In this paper, we propose a very general node-breaker approach, employing multi-port element models and using a sparse tableau formulation (STF) for network constraints. Instead of treating breaker action as altering network topology, and hence changing the structure of Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) and Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) equations, this approach represents a breaker's position as impacting only constraints associated with a single component, thereby maintaining fixed structure in the KVL and KCL constraints. While larger numbers of variables are required, STF proves sparser than Ybus formulations. Numerical case studies herein demonstrate that STF provides computational efficiency comparable to a Ybus-based ACOPF at the scale of several hundred buses, and lower computational cost in an example of over one thousand buses.},

In this paper, we formulate a probabilistic AC optimal power flow where the uncertainties are accounted for using chance constraints on line currents and voltage magnitudes. The chance constraints ensure that the probability of limit violations remain small, but require a tractable reformulation. To achieve this, an approximate, analytical reformulation of the chance constraints is developed based on linearization around the expected operating point and the assumption of normally distributed deviations. Further, an iterative solution approach is suggested, which allows for a straightforward adaption of the method based on any existing AC OPF implementation. We evaluate the performance of our method in a case study on the 24-bus IEEE RTS96 system. The proposed algorithm is found to converge fast and substantially reduce constraint violations.},

This approach exploits the globally convergent properties of continuation methods. Continuation methods achieve robustness by generating a sequence of nonlinear problems and repeatedly and consistently providing good initial guesses for locally convergent nonlinear solvers such as Newton-Raphson. The Homotopy implemented in this paper, (referred to as Power Flow Homotopy, PFH), is formulated in a way that gradually transforms the easy DC into the difficult AC Power Flow. Successive changes of the homotopy parameter modify the system of equations from fully linear and convex DC into non-linear and non-convex AC (optimal) power flow. As a result, the AC solution is obtained with increased robustness and multiple AC power flow solutions can also be detected. Similarly, Optimal Power Flow Homotopy (OPFH) is defined for solving AC Optimal Power Flow, by gradually transforming the convex DC OPF problem. Simulation results provide a comparison between the simple Newton-Raphson method and PFH in terms of performance and quality of detected solution. Comparisons are also performed between the Interior-Point method and OPFH. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is a fundamental building block for the optimization of electrical power systems. It is nonlinear and nonconvex and computes the generator setpoints for power and voltage, given a set of load demands. It is often needed to be solved repeatedly under various conditions, either in real-time or in large-scale studies. This need is further exacerbated by the increasing stochasticity of power systems due to renewable energy sources in front and behind the meter. To address these challenges, this paper presents a deep learning approach to the OPF. The learning model exploits the information available in the prior states of the system (which is commonly available in practical applications), as well as a dual Lagrangian method to satisfy the physical and engineering constraints present in the OPF. The proposed model is evaluated on a large collection of realistic power systems. The experimental results show that its predictions are highly accurate with average errors as low as 0.2%. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to improve the accuracy of widely adopted OPF linear DC approximation by at least two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Power system operation has recently witnessed major challenges, which are often due to large-scale integrations of wind power generation. In this paper, a two-stage robust security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model is proposed for managing the wind power uncertainty in the hourly scheduling of power system generation. Different from previous studies on robust SCUC, which considered a predefined uncertainty set, the proposed method applies a flexible uncertainty set for managing the variable wind power generation. The proposed method seeks a feasible and economic dispatch in the flexible uncertainty set, takes into account wind spillage and load curtailment risks, and makes a tradeoff between the optimal wind power absorption and the economic grid operation. Several case studies are applied to the proposed method and the corresponding solutions are analyzed in the paper. The impacts of major factors, including flexible generation resources and power transmission capacity, on the proposed solution are also discussed. The numerical results demonstrate the merits of the proposed method for managing large variations in the hourly wind power generation and lowering the power system operation cost in uncertain conditions.},

abstract = {AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) formulation, in general, is nonlinear and non-convex in nature and hence its application to problems like robust system operation, optimal transmission switching, etc. is a herculean task. Convexification of OPF is desired in order to reduce the complexity of solving such problems. Existing convex formulations such as Semi-Definite Programming (SDP), conventional Second Order Conic Programming (SOCP), and so on and their variants result either in significant optimality gap (OG) or reduced OG, albeit with the presence of non-convexity or approximations which bridge the gap between convexity and non-convexity. Due to these challenges, the current practice in the electricity sector is still to use the DCOPF (approximation of ACOPF). Hence in this paper, an exact and novel SOCP formulation of actual ACOPF has been proposed which aims for getting an equivalent convex formulation similar to the actual nonlinear, non-convex ACOPF. This also ensures attaining zero OG for mesh as well as radial networks and hence, the possibility of easily integrating this formulation in OPFs with data uncertainty. The proposed methodology has been tested on a 3 bus, IEEE 14 bus and IEEE 118 bus test systems on GAMS platform. The results thus obtained, have been compared with those obtained from DCOPF, nonlinear, non-convex ACOPF, conventional SOCP formulation for radial networks (SOCP-I) and conventional SOCP formulation for mesh networks (SOCP-II). The results ensure zero OG of the proposed SOCP formulation.},

The California ISO is responsible for the operation of 25,526 circuit-miles of long-distance, high voltage power lines that deliver electricity throughout most of California (California Grid) and between adjacent balancing authorities, neighboring states, Canada and northern Mexico. In 2006, the California ISO delivered 249.2 million megawatts hours of electricity and had a peak demand of 50,270 megawatts. The California ISO's principle objective is to ensure the reliability of the California Grid, while fostering a low-cost wholesale marketplace for electrical generation and related services in California. The California ISO operates pursuant to its Tariff fi led with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. A fi ve-member Board of Governors oversees the California ISO. Members are appointed by the governor, with consideration of recommendations from stakeholders, and are confi rmed by the California State Senate. Current policies demonstrate that California is at the forefront of advancing renewable resource development. In the next few years, the state requires that electricity providers serve 20 percent of their retail load from renewable resources. Statewide, greenhouse gas emissions will also be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. At the same time, California recognizes the importance of maintaining reliable electric service for consumers, which is primarily the responsibility of the California Independent System Operator Corporation (California ISO). Consistent with that responsibility, the Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) and other environmental policies, the California ISO is proud to assist in meeting the state's objectives. The California ISO has taken several important programmatic steps related to transmission interconnections for remote resources such as renewables, market policies to facilitate successful integration of renewable resources, and enhancement of demand response opportunities consistent with state and federal priorities. These policies, however, have not addressed the reliability issues associated with the large increase in intermittent renewable generation that is expected in the next several years.},

abstract = {At a high level, the report concludes that as an electric system approaches a significant penetration in variable resources: Essential reliability services will be strained; Technical aspects of the evolving resource mix must be given due consideration at state, federal, and provincial levels; Solution sets for maintaining reliability can come from: Market tools and rules, New technology integration, and Standards or requirements; and Unresolved cost implications can impede solution sets. In summary, NERC recommends the following: NERC, state and provincial regulators, and industry should use an analytical basis for understanding potential reliability impacts as a result of increasing VERs and how those impacts can affect system configuration, composition, and essential reliability services. Based on analytical results and the broad experience of NERC stakeholders, specific recommendations for changes to operating and planning practices, state and provincial programs, and pertinent NERC Reliability Standards should be developed. Specific recommendations to date are provided in the NERC IVGTF reports listed in Appendix 2. VER issues can be addressed through many non-NERC avenues (e.g., market rules; vertically integrated operations; or federal, state, and provincial programs). However, it is recommended that NERC work with affected entities in the different NERC Regions, including state and provincial agencies that have jurisdiction over VERs, wholesale market areas, and vertically integrated utilities, to develop appropriate guidelines, practices, and requirements to address VER integration issues that impact the reliability of the BPS. CAISO recommendations are included throughout the report and are specific to the CAISO area. While these recommendations represent good industry practice in meeting reliability objectives, consideration of region-specific issues and tailored approaches will likely be needed as other areas observe increasing VER trends. Specific items for consideration include: Reactive power control Active power control Inertia and Frequency Response Steady-State, Short-Circuit, and Dynamic Generic Model Development},

abstract = {Preventive control (PC) and corrective control (CC) are complementary actions in protecting large power systems against the risk of blackout. This paper addresses the optimal coordination between PC and CC via a preventive-corrective security-constrained optimal power flow model. The objective is to minimize the total expected-security-control cost which is the sum of the costs of PC and CC considering the probability of the contingencies. The constraints include system operating limits in pre-and post-contingency states, the existence of the post-contingency short-term equilibrium, and the coupling constraints on the CC actions. To solve the model, a hybrid computational strategy combining evolutionary algorithm and interior-point method is developed. The solution process consists of globally searching the critical feasible region and locally optimizing the operating variables in the found region, the two procedures interact iteratively to progressively tighten the solution region leading to the final solution. The proposed model and computational strategy are demonstrated on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems. To speed up the computation, parallel processing of the approach is implemented. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The ACOPF can be formulated as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic optimization problem, which is well known to be challenging because of nonlinearity and nonconvexity. We present a decomposable reformulation of the ACOPF, in which variables are copied and linear consensus constraints are added. This decomposability is realized once the consensus constraints are relaxed, thus leading to a particular Lagrangian dual of the ACOPF. We apply a recently developed scalable dual solution approach to the ACOPF based on an augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) that integrates the proximal bundle method with the simplicial decomposition method (SDM) and a Gauss-Seidel method, called SDM-ALM, which is used to solve a primal, convexified characterization of the Lagrangian dual of the ACOPF. We provide computational results demonstrating the scalability of our dual solution approach.},

The approach includes three steps: forecast data acquisition, statistical analysis of retrospective information, and prediction of grid balancing requirements for a specified time horizon and a given confidence level. An assessment of the capacity and ramping requirements is performed using a specially developed probabilistic algorithm based on histogram analysis, capable of incorporating multiple sources of uncertainty&#x2014;both continuous (wind and load forecast errors) and discrete (forced generator outages and startup failures). A new method called the &#x201C;flying-brick&#x201D; technique is developed to evaluate the look-ahead required generation performance envelope for the worst-case scenario within a user-specified confidence level. A self-validation process is used to validate the accuracy of the confidence intervals. To demonstrate the validity of the developed uncertainty assessment methods and its impact on grid operation, a framework for integrating the proposed methods with an energy management system (EMS) is developed. Demonstration through EMS integration illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology and the developed tool for actual grid operation and paves the road for integration with EMS systems in control rooms.},

The aim of this paper is on providing solutions that are more robust to short-term deviations, and that optimize both the initial operating point and a parametrized response policy for control during fluctuations. We formulate this as a chance-constrained optimization problem. To obtain a tractable representation of the chance constraints, we introduce a number of modeling assumptions and leverage recent theoretical results to reformulate the problem as a convex, second-order cone program, which is efficiently solvable even for large instances. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed procedure improves the feasibility and cost performance of the OPF solution, while the additional computation time is on the same magnitude as a single deterministic AC OPF calculation.},

To ensure secure system operation, new tools that account for this uncertainty are required. In this paper, we adopt a chance-constrained AC optimal power flow formulation, which guarantees that generation, power flows, and voltages remain within their bounds with a predefined probability. We then discuss different chance-constraint reformulations and solution approaches for the problem. We first describe an analytical reformulation based on partial linearization, which enables us to obtain a tractable representation of the optimization problem. We then provide an efficient algorithm based on an iterative solution scheme which alternates between solving a deterministic AC optimal power flow problem and assessing the impact of uncertainty. The flexibility of the iterative scheme enables not only scalable implementations, but also alternative chance-constraint reformulations. In particular, we suggest two sample-based reformulations that do not require any approximation or relaxation of the AC power flow equations. In a case study based on four different IEEE systems, we assess the performance of the method, and demonstrate scalability of the iterative scheme. We further show that the analytical reformulation accurately and efficiently enforces chance constraints in both in-and out-of-sample tests, and that the analytical reformulations outperforms the two alternative, sample-based chance constraint reformulations.},

The method incorporates a local curvature approximation scheme, with underlying parameter update steps inspired by the local residual balancing scheme, to automatically tune the penalty parameters locally, without central oversight. Substantial speed-ups over the vanilla ADMM, as high as 10.6 times, are demonstrated on real-world test systems with more than 13\,600 buses, as well as on other difficult test cases. Furthermore, scalability is assessed by showing that, unlike in the centralized computation, the distributed implementation of the proposed adaptive method is independent of system size.},

The system security is controlled through an overall system risk constraint, which accumulates the individual risk related to each contingency, defined as the product between the probability of contingency occurrence and the contingency severity. The latter is expressed in terms of the amount of voluntary load shedding which, complementary to conventional corrective actions, is able to correct violation of post-contingency long-term thermal limits. The existing RB-SCOPF formulations are enhanced with short-term thermal post-contingency limits, aimed at avoiding cascade line tripping, and TSO operating rule.

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review of the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem and propose areas where the ACOPF could be improved. The ACOPF is at the heart of Independent System Operator (ISO) power markets, and is solved in some form every year for system planning, every day for day-ahead markets, every hour, and even every 5 minutes. It was first formulated in 1962, and formulations have changed little over the years. With advances in computing power and solution algorithms, we can model more of the constraints and remove unnecessary limits and approximations that were previously required to find a solution in reasonable time. One example is nonlinear voltage magnitude constraints that are modeled as linear thermal proxy constraints. In this paper, we refer to the full ACOPF as an ACOPF that simultaneously optimizes real and reactive power. Today, 50 years after the problem was formulated, we still do not have a fast, robust solution technique for the full ACOPF. Finding a good solution technique for the full ACOPF could potentially save tens of billions of dollars annually. Based on our literature review, we find that the ACOPF research community lacks a common understanding of the problem, its formulation, and objective functions. However, we do not claim that this literature review is a complete review-our intent was simply to capture the major formulations of the ACOPF. Instead, in this paper, we seek to clearly present the ACOPF problem through clear formulations of the problem and its parameters. This paper defines and discusses the polar power-voltage, rectangular power-voltage, and rectangular current-voltage formulations of the ACOPF. Additionally, it discusses the different types of constraints and objective functions. This paper lays the groundwork for further research on the convex approximation of the ACOPF solution space, a survey of solution techniques, and computational performance of different formulations.},

The major contribution of this dissertation is in the development of a generalized three-phase optimal power flow (OPF) program in a novel control scheme for future distribution system optimization and economic operation. It is developed based on primal-dual interior point method (PDIPM). The program is general enough to model comprehensive system components and topologies. The program can also be customized by user-defined cost functions, system constraints, and new device, such as solid state transformers (SST). An energy storage optimal control using dynamic programming is also proposed to coordinate with the OPF based on a pricing signal called the distribution locational marginal price (DLMP). The proposed OPF program can be used by the DNO in an open access competitive control scheme to optimally aggregate the energy mix by combining the profitability of each resource while satisfying system security constraints.},

Iterative methods such as the conjugate gradient method have been applied to power system applications in the literature for its parallelism potential with larger systems. Preconditioner, used for preconditioning the linear system for a better convergence rate in iterative computations, is an indispensable part of iterative solving process. This work implemented a polynomial preconditioner Chebyshev preconditioner with graphic processing unit (GPU), and integrated a GPU-based conjugate gradient solver.

First, substations are geographically placed on a selected territory, synthesized from public information about the underlying population and generation plants. A clustering technique is employed, which ensures the synthetic substations meet realistic proportions of load and generation, among other constraints. Next, a network of transmission lines is added. This paper describes several structural statistics to be used in characterizing real power system networks, including connectivity, Delaunay triangulation overlap, dc power flow analysis, and line intersection rate. The paper presents a methodology to generate synthetic line topologies with realistic parameters that satisfy these criteria.

The two interact iteratively to progressively approach the final solution. The proposed method is verified on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems. Comparison studies show that (i) CSCOPF can better balance the security and economy and (ii) the hybrid method is overall superior (in solution quality, robustness and convergence characteristic) over the single evolutionary algorithm. Parallel processing is applied to speed-up the computations. {\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new fuzzy adaptive artificial physics optimization (FAAPO) algorithm is used to solve security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problem with wind and thermal power generators. The stochastic nature of wind speed is modeled as a Weibull probability density function. The production cost is modeled with the overestimation and underestimation of available wind energy and included in the conventional SCOPF. Wind generation cost model comprises two components, viz. reserve capacity cost for wind power surplus and penalty cost for wind power shortage. The selection of optimal gravitational constant (G) is a tedious process in conventional artificial physics optimization (APO) method. To overcome this limitation, the gravitational constant (G) is fuzzified in this work. Therefore, based upon the requirement, the gravitational constant changes adaptively. Hence, production cost is reduced, settles at optimum point and takes less number of iterations. The proposed algorithm is tested on IEEE 30-bus system and Indian 75-bus practical system, including wind power in both the test systems. It is observed that FAAPO can outperform BAT algorithm and APO algorithm. Hence, the proposed algorithm can be used for integration of wind power with thermal power generators.},

abstract = {Conventional economic dispatch models aim to determine the optimal production of generation units under the steady state operation constraints. Due to the growing integration of low inertia power generation technologies (e.g. wind, solar, etc.), considering stability constraints, in particular, frequency stability, a theme of this work, becomes a crucial need in nowadays security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) programs. This paper develops a new look ahead dynamic (i.e. multi-period) security-constrained economic dispatch model, further considering frequency stability constraints (DSCED-FSC). The aim of the DSCED-FSC is to optimize the cost of power generation subject to operation and frequency stability constraints under normal and contingency conditions. The proposed DSCED-FSC secures N-1 contingencies for both thermal limits and frequency stability. The system frequency response is included in DSCED-FSC model by linearizing the discretized rotor angle swing equation. The dynamic models of governors and load damping are considered in the discretized system frequency response. The safety of system frequency response under generation outages is provided by activating generators' governors, inertial response and load damping as the primary frequency reserve. In addition to primary frequency reserve, the demand elasticity of smart motor loads is utilized to avoid the activation of under frequency load shedding (UFLS) relays under severe generation outages. The proposed DSCED-FSC model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The nonlinear AC power flow equations are linearized using Taylor series expansions and piecewise linear (PWL) approximation techniques. The efficacy of the proposed DSCED-FSC model in supporting system frequency is investigated using the IEEE 118-bus test system.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new P-Q decomposition approach to solve the AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem. An alternative power flow model based on line flow equations (LFB) is used. In traditional power flow, the voltage magnitude and phase angle at each bus are treated as the independent variables. In the LFB model, the real and reactive power flows through the line along with the bus voltage magnitudes constitute the independent variables. The formulation is done by decoupling the OPF problem into active power and reactive power subproblems using line flow equations. Unlike traditional decomposition methods, the technique adopted in this approach does not ignore the weak coupling between the subjacobians. Taking a pragmatic point of view and eschewing complicated mathematical algorithms, the paper presents a solution procedure using Genetic Algorithm methodology. Following a detailed description of the steps in the new approach, test results from an implementation of the proposed algorithm on a bench mark test system are presented. The results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for achieving a practically acceptable solution to the AC OPF problem.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how fast-response distributed battery energy storage could be used to implement post-contingency corrective control actions. Immediately after a contingency, the injections of distributed batteries could be adjusted to alleviate overloads and reduce flows below their short-term emergency rating. This ensures that the post-contingency system remains stable until the operator has redispatched the generation. Implementing this form of corrective control would allow operators to take advantage of the difference between the short- and long-term ratings of the lines and would therefore increase the available transmission capacity. This problem is formulated as a two-stage, enhanced security-constrained OPF problem, in which the first-stage optimizes the pre-contingency generation dispatch, while the second-stage minimizes the corrective actions for each contingency. Case studies based on a six-bus test system and on the RTS 96 demonstrate that the proposed method provides effective corrective actions and can guarantee operational reliability and economy.},

A scenario generation method is also presented to model the uncertainties of wind generations and load demands considering their correlations. In the proposed model, the uncertainties are coped with through combination of optimal here-and-now and wait-and-see decisions. The effectiveness of the proposed model is shown on the well-known IEEE 24-bus test system. Higher effectiveness of the proposed model compared with four deterministic methods and one other stochastic method to determine procured reserve and ‘after-the-fact' conditions is numerically illustrated. Additionally, the impact of the number of scenarios on the performance of the proposed model is evaluated by means of a sensitivity analysis.

abstract = {We propose a branch flow model for the analysis and optimization of mesh as well as radial networks. The model leads to a new approach to solving optimal power flow (OPF) that consists of two relaxation steps. The first step eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial networks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there are no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always exact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification of mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network can always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the network and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints. Part I introduces our branch flow model, explains the two relaxation steps, and proves the conditions for exact relaxation. Part II describes convexification of mesh networks, and presents simulation results. {\textcopyright} 1969-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Increased levels of variable renewable generation lead to increased variations in power flows. If the required transmission capacity is provided by a grid with no or little controllability as in today's power system, the consequence is a significant under-utilization of the transmission assets most of the time. In this paper, corrective power flow control is used to improve the utilization of the existing transmission capabilities and adjust the grid to the varying needs of generation and demand. In lieu of the traditional N-1 security formulation, a risk based approach is employed. The resulting risk constrained economic dispatch is solved efficiently by decomposing it into a two stage process by using newly defined locational security impact factors (LSIF). In addition, these LSIFs provide information on the most effective, location-dependent measures to reduce system risk. Simulations provide insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the potential of corrective power flow control to reduce cost of dispatched generation and to decrease system risk. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {There has been a strong increase of penetration of renewable energies into power systems. However, the renewables pose new challenges for the operation of the networks. Particularly, wind power is intermittently fluctuating, and, therefore, the network operator has to fast update the operations correspondingly. This task should be performed by an online optimization. Therefore, real-time optimal power flow (RT-OPF) has become an attractive topic in recent years. This paper presents an overview of recent studies on RT-OPF under wind energy penetration, offering a critical review of the major advancements in RT-OPF. It describes the challenges in the realization of the RT-OPF and presents available approaches to address these challenges. The paper focuses on a number of topics which are reviewed in chronological order of appearance: offline energy management systems (EMSs) (deterministic and stochastic approaches) and real-time EMSs (constraint satisfaction-based and OPF-based methods). The particular challenges associated with the incorporation of battery storage systems in the networks are explored, and it is concluded that the current research on RT-OPF is not sufficient, and new solution approaches are needed.},

This approach can accommodate any set of N-k generation and transmission contingencies, and the probabilities of the contingencies are sensitive to common mode failures and adverse weather conditions.

@article{Madani2015,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. We have recently shown that a convex relaxation based on semidefinite programming (SDP) is able to find a global solution of OPF for IEEE benchmark systems, and moreover this technique is guaranteed to work over acyclic (distribution) networks. The present work studies the potential of the SDP relaxation for OPF over mesh (transmission) networks. First, we consider a simple class of cyclic systems, namely weakly-cyclic networks with cycles of size 3. We show that the success of the SDP relaxation depends on how the line capacities are modeled mathematically. More precisely, the SDP relaxation is proven to succeed if the capacity of each line is modeled in terms of bus voltage difference, as opposed to line active power, apparent power or angle difference. This result elucidates the role of the problem formulation. Our second contribution is to relate the rank of the minimum-rank solution of the SDP relaxation to the network topology. The goal is to understand how the computational complexity of OPF is related to the underlying topology of the power network. To this end, an upper bound is derived on the rank of the SDP solution, which is expected to be small in practice. A penalization method is then applied to the SDP relaxation to enforce the rank of its solution to become 1, leading to a near-optimal solution for OPF with a guaranteed optimality degree. The remarkable performance of this technique is demonstrated on IEEE systems with more than 7000 different cost functions.},

New methods for power system operational planning are needed to allow for efficient use of the grid, while maintaining security against disturbances. In this paper, we propose a risk model for risks related to outages, accounting for available remedial measures and the impact of cascading events. The new risk model is used to formulate risk-based constraints for the post-contingency line flows, which are included in an optimal power flow (OPF) formulation. Forecast uncertainty is accounted for by formulating the relevant constraints as a joint chance constraint, and the problem is solved using a sampling-based technique. In a case study of the IEEE 30 bus system, we demonstrate how the proposed risk-based, probabilistic OPF allows us to control the risk level, even in presence of uncertainty. We investigate the trade-off between generation cost and risk level in the system, and show how accounting for uncertainty leads to a more expensive, but more secure dispatch.},

This paper proposes a semidefinite relaxation of a chance-constrained AC-OPF, which is able to provide guarantees for global optimality. Using a piecewise affine policy, we can ensure tractability, accurately model large power deviations, and determine suitable corrective control policies for active power, reactive power, and voltage. We state a tractable formulation for two types of uncertainty sets. Using a scenario-based approach and making no prior assumptions about the probability distribution of the forecast errors, we obtain a robust formulation for a rectangular uncertainty set. Alternatively, assuming a Gaussian distribution of the forecast errors, we propose an analytical reformulation of the chance constraints suitable for semidefinite programming. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the IEEE 24 and 118 bus system using realistic day-Ahead forecast data and obtain tight near-global optimality guarantees.},

The problem is formulated as a chance constrained convex program; to deal with the chance constraint we follow an algorithm based on a combination of randomized and robust optimization.

This scheme allows us to inherit a priori probabilistic guarantees regarding the satisfaction of the system constraints, unlike the base case where the AVR set-points are constant.

This paper is a systematic study of the QC relaxation for AC optimal power flow with realistic side constraints. The main theoretical result shows that the QC relaxation is stronger than the SOC relaxation and neither dominates nor is dominated by the SDP relaxation. In addition, comprehensive computational results show that the QC relaxation may produce significant improvements in accuracy over the SOC relaxation at a reasonable computational cost, especially for networks with tight bounds on phase angle differences. The QC and SOC relaxations are also shown to be significantly faster and reliable compared to the SDP relaxation given the current state of the respective solvers.},

Previous studies have shown that the use of corrective control in response to outages contributes to a reduction in operating cost, while maintaining N-1 security. In this work, we propose a method to extend the use of corrective control of PSTs and HVDCs to react to uncertainty. We characterize the uncertainty as continuous random variables, and define the corrective control actions through affine control policies. This allows us to efficiently model control reactions to a large number of uncertainty sources. The control policies are then included in a chance constrained optimal power flow formulation, which guarantees that the system constraints are enforced with a desired probability. By applying an analytical reformulation of the chance constraints, we obtain a second-order cone problem for which we develop an efficient solution algorithm. In a case study for the IEEE 118 bus system, we show that corrective control for uncertainty leads to a decrease in operational cost, while maintaining system security. Further, we demonstrate the scalability of the method by solving the problem for the IEEE 300 bus and the Polish system test cases.},

Under such circumstances, in the presence of conflicting contingencies, the deterministic AC security-constrained optimal power flow problem, which computes the optimal mix of preventive and corrective actions to enforce N-1 security, may be infeasible and hence its computations diverge. In such a case, the transmission system operator absolutely needs a usable solution which minimizes in some manner the degree of problem infeasibility or the risk of operation insecurity.

abstract = {This study presents a novel linear approximated methodology for full alternating current-optimal power flow (AC-OPF). The AC-OPF can provide more precise and real picture of full active and reactive power flow modelling, along with the voltage profile of buses compared to the commonly used direct current-optimal power flow. While the AC-OPF is a non-linear programming problem, this can be transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming environment by the proposed model without loss of accuracy. The global optimality of the solution for the approximated model can be guaranteed by existing algorithms and software. The numerical results and simulations which represent the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model are given and completely discussed in this study.},

abstract = {The ACOPF is at the core of competitive wholesale electricity markets and vertically integrated utility operations. The ACOPF simultaneously co-optimizes real and reactive power. First formulated over half a century ago in 1962 by Carpentier, the ACOPF is the most representative mathematical programming-based formulation of steady-state operations in AC networks. However the ACOPF is not solved in practice due to the nonconvex, nonlinear structure of the problem, for which finding the globally optimal solution is known to be NP-hard. Instead, least-cost unit commitment and generation dispatch in the day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time markets is determined with numerous simplifications of the ACOPF. This work presents a series of essays on the ACOPF problem, which include formulations, approximations, and applications in the electricity markets. The main themes center around ACOPF modeling fundamentals, followed by local and global solution methods to solve the problem for a variety of applications in the electricity markets. Original contributions of these essays include an alternative formulation of the ACOPF, a successive linear programming algorithm to solving the ACOPF for the real-time market, an outer approximation method to solving integrated ACOPF-unit commitment as a mixed-integer linear program for the day-ahead market, and applications of convex relaxations to the ACOPF and its approximations for the purpose of globally optimal storage integration. These contributions are concluded with a discussion of potential future directions of work.},

The generator models are represented using conductance and susceptance state variables, and the operational and network constraints are translated to corresponding current/voltage constraints without loss of accuracy or generality. To understand the physics behind the optimality conditions of the optimization problem, we extend the linear adjoint circuit theory to translate them to equivalent circuit domain. It is shown that the operating point that defines the equivalent circuit solution precisely represents an AC-OPF solution. We then further exploit the equivalent circuit representation to use power flow simulation techniques to robustly solve the optimization problem. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated for several AC-OPF benchmark test cases (up to 70 k buses) under nominal and congested operating conditions, and the runtime and scalability properties are presented.},

To achieve this, we integrate the security constraints in a DC optimal power flow optimization and formulate a stochastic program with chance constraints, which encode the probability of satisfying the transmission capacity constraints of the lines and the generation limits. To solve the resulting problem numerically, we transform the initial problem to a tractable one by using the so-called scenario approach, which is based on sampling the uncertain parameter while keeping the desired probabilistic guarantees. To generate wind power scenarios a Markov chain-based model is employed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique we apply it to the IEEE 30-bus network, and compare it with the solution of a deterministic variant of the problem, where the operator determines a secure generation dispatch based only on the available wind power forecast.

The algorithm is based on a multi-agent system, in which geographically distributed network entities are designated as agents with local sensing, communication, and computation abilities as envisioned for a smart grid. This distributed approach is based on solving the first order optimality conditions associated with DC-SCOPF formulation through an iterative process. At each iteration, each agent updates a few local variables through simple computations, and exchanges information with its neighboring agents. In particular, the updates for each agent incorporate local information such as the Lagrange multipliers, as well as enforcing the supply/demand balance through a local innovation term. Also, the performance is evaluated using the IEEE test systems with 14 and 57 buses and a 944-bus system consisting of eight IEEE 118-bus systems.

If, however, the relaxation is inexact, the obtained solution is not AC-feasible. The quality of the obtained solution is essential for several practical applications of AC-OPF, but detailed analyses are lacking in existing literature. This paper aims to cover this gap. We provide an in-depth investigation of the solution characteristics when convex relaxations are inexact, we assess the most promising AC feasibility recovery methods for large-scale systems, and we propose two new metrics that lead to a better understanding of the quality of the identified solutions. We perform a comprehensive assessment on 96 different test cases, ranging from 14 to 3120 buses, and we show that (i) despite an optimality gap of less than 1%, several test cases still exhibit substantial distances to both AC feasibility and local optimality and the newly proposed metrics characterize these deviations, (ii) penalization methods fail to recover an AC-feasible solution in 16 out of 45 cases, and (iii) the computational benefits of warm-starting non-convex solvers have significant variation, but a computational speedup exists in over 75% of the cases.},

The objective is to maximize the total expected net benefits over the planning horizon, incorporating the costs and benefits of electricity consumption, generation, ancillary services, load-shedding, storage and load-shifting. The overall framework could be characterized as a secure, stochastic, combined unit commitment and AC optimal power flow problem, solving for an optimal state-dependent schedule over a pre-specified time horizon. Uncertainty is modeled to expose the scenarios that are critical for maintaining system security, while properly representing the stochastic cost. The optimal amount of locational reserves needed to cover a credible set of contingencies in each time period is determined, as well as load-following reserves required for ramping between time periods. The models for centrally-dispatched storage and time-flexible demands allow for optimal tradeoffs between arbitraging across time, mitigating uncertainty and covering contingencies. This paper details the proposed problem formulation and outlines potential approaches to solving it.

abstract = {This paper focuses on distribution systems featuring renewable energy sources (RESs) and energy storage systems, and presents an AC optimal power flow (OPF) approach to optimize system-level performance objectives while coping with uncertainty in both RES generation and loads. The proposed method hinges on a chance-constrained AC OPF formulation, where probabilistic constraints are utilized to enforce voltage regulation with prescribed probability. A computationally more affordable convex reformulation is developed by resorting to suitable linear approximations of the AC power-flow equations as well as convex approximations of the chance constraints. The approximate chance constraints provide conservative bounds that hold for arbitrary distributions of the forecasting errors. An adaptive strategy is then obtained by embedding the proposed AC OPF task into a model predictive control framework. Finally, a distributed solver is developed to strategically distribute the solution of the optimization problems across utility and customers.},

The deviations from the wind power forecast are represented as Gaussian random variables and an analytical reformulation of the constraints is proposed, which is exact for the Gaussian distribution. The resulting formulation has the same computational complexity as the deterministic problem. Furthermore, a valuation framework to assess the cost of securing the system against fluctuations in wind power in-feed is proposed. The applicability of the method and the valuation framework is demonstrated on the IEEE RTS96 system.

We first discuss the issues related to the SCOPF problem formulation such as the use of a limited number of corrective actions in the post-contingency states and the modeling of voltage and transient stability constraints. Then we deal with the challenges to the techniques for solving the SCOPF, focusing mainly on: approaches to reduce the size of the problem by either efficiently identifying the binding contingencies and including only these contingencies in the SCOPF or by using approximate models for the post-contingency states, and the handling of discrete variables. We finally address the current trend of extending the SCOPF formulation to take into account the increasing levels of uncertainty in the operation planning. For each such topic we provide a review of the state of the art, we identify the advances that are needed, and we indicate ways to bridge the gap between the current state of the art and these needs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The quality of the obtained solution is essential for several practical applications of AC-OPF, but detailed analyses are lacking in existing literature. This paper aims to cover this gap. We provide an in-depth investigation of the solution characteristics when convex relaxations are inexact, we assess the most promising AC feasibility recovery methods for large-scale systems, and we propose two new metrics that lead to a better understanding of the quality of the identified solutions. We perform a comprehensive assessment on 96 different test cases, ranging from 14 to 3120 buses, and we show that (i) despite an optimality gap of less than 1%, several test cases still exhibit substantial distances to both AC feasibility and local optimality and the newly proposed metrics characterize these deviations, (ii) penalization methods fail to recover an AC-feasible solution in 16 out of 45 cases, and (iii) the computational benefits of warm-starting non-convex solvers have significant variation, but a computational speedup exists in over 75% of the cases.},

We show that by combining these two complementary ideas, it is possible to solve in a reasonable time SCOPF problems on large power system models with a large number of contingencies. Unlike most results reported for large-scale SCOPF problems, our algorithm uses a nonlinear AC network model in both pre-contingency and post-contingency states, optimizes both active/reactive powers flows jointly, and treats the discrete variables.

abstract = {AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) formulation, in general, is nonlinear and non-convex in nature and hence its application to problems like robust system operation, optimal transmission switching, etc. is a herculean task. Convexification of OPF is desired in order to reduce the complexity of solving such problems. Existing convex formulations such as Semi-Definite Programming (SDP), conventional Second Order Conic Programming (SOCP), and so on and their variants result either in significant optimality gap (OG) or reduced OG, albeit with the presence of non-convexity or approximations which bridge the gap between convexity and non-convexity. Due to these challenges, the current practice in the electricity sector is still to use the DCOPF (approximation of ACOPF). Hence in this paper, an exact and novel SOCP formulation of actual ACOPF has been proposed which aims for getting an equivalent convex formulation similar to the actual nonlinear, non-convex ACOPF. This also ensures attaining zero OG for mesh as well as radial networks and hence, the possibility of easily integrating this formulation in OPFs with data uncertainty. The proposed methodology has been tested on a 3 bus, IEEE 14 bus and IEEE 118 bus test systems on GAMS platform. The results thus obtained, have been compared with those obtained from DCOPF, nonlinear, non-convex ACOPF, conventional SOCP formulation for radial networks (SOCP-I) and conventional SOCP formulation for mesh networks (SOCP-II). The results ensure zero OG of the proposed SOCP formulation.},

abstract = {The present distribution system is gradually trending towards a smart grid paradigm with massive development of distributed energy resources (DER), advanced power electronics interfaces, and a digitalized communication platform. Such profound changes bring challenges as well as opportunities for an entity like the distribution network operator (DNO) to optimally operate DERs and other controllable elements to achieve higher levels of energy efficiency, economic benefits, supply reliability and power quality. The major contribution of this dissertation is in the development of a generalized three-phase optimal power flow (OPF) program in a novel control scheme for future distribution system optimization and economic operation. It is developed based on primal-dual interior point method (PDIPM). The program is general enough to model comprehensive system components and topologies. The program can also be customized by user-defined cost functions, system constraints, and new device, such as solid state transformers (SST). An energy storage optimal control using dynamic programming is also proposed to coordinate with the OPF based on a pricing signal called the distribution locational marginal price (DLMP). The proposed OPF program can be used by the DNO in an open access competitive control scheme to optimally aggregate the energy mix by combining the profitability of each resource while satisfying system security constraints.},

abstract = {There has been a strong increase of penetration of renewable energies into power systems. However, the renewables pose new challenges for the operation of the networks. Particularly, wind power is intermittently fluctuating, and, therefore, the network operator has to fast update the operations correspondingly. This task should be performed by an online optimization. Therefore, real-time optimal power flow (RT-OPF) has become an attractive topic in recent years. This paper presents an overview of recent studies on RT-OPF under wind energy penetration, offering a critical review of the major advancements in RT-OPF. It describes the challenges in the realization of the RT-OPF and presents available approaches to address these challenges. The paper focuses on a number of topics which are reviewed in chronological order of appearance: offline energy management systems (EMSs) (deterministic and stochastic approaches) and real-time EMSs (constraint satisfaction-based and OPF-based methods). The particular challenges associated with the incorporation of battery storage systems in the networks are explored, and it is concluded that the current research on RT-OPF is not sufficient, and new solution approaches are needed.},

We first discuss the issues related to the SCOPF problem formulation such as the use of a limited number of corrective actions in the post-contingency states and the modeling of voltage and transient stability constraints. Then we deal with the challenges to the techniques for solving the SCOPF, focusing mainly on: approaches to reduce the size of the problem by either efficiently identifying the binding contingencies and including only these contingencies in the SCOPF or by using approximate models for the post-contingency states, and the handling of discrete variables. We finally address the current trend of extending the SCOPF formulation to take into account the increasing levels of uncertainty in the operation planning. For each such topic we provide a review of the state of the art, we identify the advances that are needed, and we indicate ways to bridge the gap between the current state of the art and these needs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To enable the application of efficient and robust solution algorithms, various linear approximations of the nonlinear system model are used. However, this may lead to solutions that are AC suboptimal or even infeasible. This paper proposes new linearization techniques for constructing accurate line flow constraints that reduce the complexity of the AC optimal power flow problem without compromising the solution quality. In particular, it investigates the shape of the nonlinear constraints in polar coordinates and presents methods for producing conservative linear approximations with a desired accuracy. Numerical experiments are performed on systems with 118, 300 and 1354 buses. Obtained results indicate that the proposed formulation leads to a significant decrease in the computation time while at the same time providing high quality approximations of the exact line flows.},

The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is a departure from these relaxations in the sense that it imposes constraints to preserve stronger links between the voltage variables through convex envelopes of the polar representation. This paper is a systematic study of the QC relaxation for AC optimal power flow with realistic side constraints. The main theoretical result shows that the QC relaxation is stronger than the SOC relaxation and neither dominates nor is dominated by the SDP relaxation. In addition, comprehensive computational results show that the QC relaxation may produce significant improvements in accuracy over the SOC relaxation at a reasonable computational cost, especially for networks with tight bounds on phase angle differences. The QC and SOC relaxations are also shown to be significantly faster and reliable compared to the SDP relaxation given the current state of the respective solvers.},

The Julia modelling package StructJuMP, allows us to compactly and conveniently express the model's algebraic components.

The algorithm is based on a multi-agent system, in which geographically distributed network entities are designated as agents with local sensing, communication, and computation abilities as envisioned for a smart grid. This distributed approach is based on solving the first order optimality conditions associated with DC-SCOPF formulation through an iterative process. At each iteration, each agent updates a few local variables through simple computations, and exchanges information with its neighboring agents. In particular, the updates for each agent incorporate local information such as the Lagrange multipliers, as well as enforcing the supply/demand balance through a local innovation term. Also, the performance is evaluated using the IEEE test systems with 14 and 57 buses and a 944-bus system consisting of eight IEEE 118-bus systems.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. We have recently shown that a convex relaxation based on semidefinite programming (SDP) is able to find a global solution of OPF for IEEE benchmark systems, and moreover this technique is guaranteed to work over acyclic (distribution) networks. The present work studies the potential of the SDP relaxation for OPF over mesh (transmission) networks. First, we consider a simple class of cyclic systems, namely weakly-cyclic networks with cycles of size 3. We show that the success of the SDP relaxation depends on how the line capacities are modeled mathematically. More precisely, the SDP relaxation is proven to succeed if the capacity of each line is modeled in terms of bus voltage difference, as opposed to line active power, apparent power or angle difference. This result elucidates the role of the problem formulation. Our second contribution is to relate the rank of the minimum-rank solution of the SDP relaxation to the network topology. The goal is to understand how the computational complexity of OPF is related to the underlying topology of the power network. To this end, an upper bound is derived on the rank of the SDP solution, which is expected to be small in practice. A penalization method is then applied to the SDP relaxation to enforce the rank of its solution to become 1, leading to a near-optimal solution for OPF with a guaranteed optimality degree. The remarkable performance of this technique is demonstrated on IEEE systems with more than 7000 different cost functions.},

By combining these two complementary simplifications, it is possible to solve SCOPF problems addressing both preventive and corrective controls on continental sized power system models and with a very large number of contingencies. The proposed algorithms are implemented with state-of-the-art solvers and applied on a model of the European transmission system, of about 15000 buses, and with about 11000 contingencies.},

abstract = {This paper deals with techniques to solve the corrective security-constrained optimal power flow (CSCOPF) problem. To this end, we propose a new iterative approach that comprises four modules: a CSCOPF which considers only a subset of potentially binding contingencies among the postulated contingencies, a (steady-state) security analysis (SSSA), a contingency filtering (CF) technique, and an OPF variant to check post-contingency state feasibility when taking into account post-contingency corrective actions. We compare performances of our approach and its possible variants with classical CSCOPF approaches such as the direct approach and Benders decomposition (BD), on three systems of 60, 118, and 1203 buses. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

The aim of this paper is on providing solutions that are more robust to short-term deviations, and that optimize both the initial operating point and a parametrized response policy for control during fluctuations. We formulate this as a chance-constrained optimization problem. To obtain a tractable representation of the chance constraints, we introduce a number of modeling assumptions and leverage recent theoretical results to reformulate the problem as a convex, second-order cone program, which is efficiently solvable even for large instances. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed procedure improves the feasibility and cost performance of the OPF solution, while the additional computation time is on the same magnitude as a single deterministic AC OPF calculation.},

abstract = {This work presents a stochastic optimization framework for operations and planning of an electricity network as managed by an Independent System Operator. The objective is to maximize the total expected net benefits over the planning horizon, incorporating the costs and benefits of electricity consumption, generation, ancillary services, load-shedding, storage and load-shifting. The overall framework could be characterized as a secure, stochastic, combined unit commitment and AC optimal power flow problem, solving for an optimal state-dependent schedule over a pre-specified time horizon. Uncertainty is modeled to expose the scenarios that are critical for maintaining system security, while properly representing the stochastic cost. The optimal amount of locational reserves needed to cover a credible set of contingencies in each time period is determined, as well as load-following reserves required for ramping between time periods. The models for centrally-dispatched storage and time-flexible demands allow for optimal tradeoffs between arbitraging across time, mitigating uncertainty and covering contingencies. This paper details the proposed problem formulation and outlines potential approaches to solving it. An implementation based on a DC power flow model solves systems of modest size and can be used to demonstrate the value of the proposed stochastic framework. {\textcopyright} 2010-2012 IEEE.},

@techreport{Cain2012,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review of the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem and propose areas where the ACOPF could be improved. The ACOPF is at the heart of Independent System Operator (ISO) power markets, and is solved in some form every year for system planning, every day for day-ahead markets, every hour, and even every 5 minutes. It was first formulated in 1962, and formulations have changed little over the years. With advances in computing power and solution algorithms, we can model more of the constraints and remove unnecessary limits and approximations that were previously required to find a solution in reasonable time. One example is nonlinear voltage magnitude constraints that are modeled as linear thermal proxy constraints. In this paper, we refer to the full ACOPF as an ACOPF that simultaneously optimizes real and reactive power. Today, 50 years after the problem was formulated, we still do not have a fast, robust solution technique for the full ACOPF. Finding a good solution technique for the full ACOPF could potentially save tens of billions of dollars annually. Based on our literature review, we find that the ACOPF research community lacks a common understanding of the problem, its formulation, and objective functions. However, we do not claim that this literature review is a complete review-our intent was simply to capture the major formulations of the ACOPF. Instead, in this paper, we seek to clearly present the ACOPF problem through clear formulations of the problem and its parameters. This paper defines and discusses the polar power-voltage, rectangular power-voltage, and rectangular current-voltage formulations of the ACOPF. Additionally, it discusses the different types of constraints and objective functions. This paper lays the groundwork for further research on the convex approximation of the ACOPF solution space, a survey of solution techniques, and computational performance of different formulations.},

This paper proposes a new PSCOPF model that optimizes the droop coefficients of the synchronized generators.

abstract = {We propose a branch flow model for the analysis and optimization of mesh as well as radial networks. The model leads to a new approach to solving optimal power flow (OPF) that consists of two relaxation steps. The first step eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial networks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there are no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always exact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification of mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network can always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the network and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints. Part I introduces our branch flow model, explains the two relaxation steps, and proves the conditions for exact relaxation. Part II describes convexification of mesh networks, and presents simulation results. {\textcopyright} 1969-2012 IEEE.},

Nonlinear generator capability curves are represented ("D-curves"), including options to allow active and reactive limits dependent on generator voltage. A uniform objective function is used throughout, that of minimizing quadratic generator operating cost curves.

First, substations are geographically placed on a selected territory, synthesized from public information about the underlying population and generation plants. A clustering technique is employed, which ensures the synthetic substations meet realistic proportions of load and generation, among other constraints. Next, a network of transmission lines is added. This paper describes several structural statistics to be used in characterizing real power system networks, including connectivity, Delaunay triangulation overlap, dc power flow analysis, and line intersection rate. The paper presents a methodology to generate synthetic line topologies with realistic parameters that satisfy these criteria. Then, the test cases can be augmented with additional complexities to build large, realistic cases. The methodology is illustrated in building a 2000 bus public test case that meets the criteria specified.},

abstract = {Conventional economic dispatch models aim to determine the optimal production of generation units under the steady state operation constraints. Due to the growing integration of low inertia power generation technologies (e.g. wind, solar, etc.), considering stability constraints, in particular, frequency stability, a theme of this work, becomes a crucial need in nowadays security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) programs. This paper develops a new look ahead dynamic (i.e. multi-period) security-constrained economic dispatch model, further considering frequency stability constraints (DSCED-FSC). The aim of the DSCED-FSC is to optimize the cost of power generation subject to operation and frequency stability constraints under normal and contingency conditions. The proposed DSCED-FSC secures N-1 contingencies for both thermal limits and frequency stability. The system frequency response is included in DSCED-FSC model by linearizing the discretized rotor angle swing equation. The dynamic models of governors and load damping are considered in the discretized system frequency response. The safety of system frequency response under generation outages is provided by activating generators' governors, inertial response and load damping as the primary frequency reserve. In addition to primary frequency reserve, the demand elasticity of smart motor loads is utilized to avoid the activation of under frequency load shedding (UFLS) relays under severe generation outages. The proposed DSCED-FSC model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The nonlinear AC power flow equations are linearized using Taylor series expansions and piecewise linear (PWL) approximation techniques. The efficacy of the proposed DSCED-FSC model in supporting system frequency is investigated using the IEEE 118-bus test system.},

Under such circumstances, in the presence of conflicting contingencies, the deterministic AC security-constrained optimal power flow problem, which computes the optimal mix of preventive and corrective actions to enforce N-1 security, may be infeasible and hence its computations diverge. In such a case, the transmission system operator absolutely needs a usable solution which minimizes in some manner the degree of problem infeasibility or the risk of operation insecurity.

An incentive-based mechanism is designed to encourage the MGs to actively cooperate with the main grid for postcontingency recovery, which makes the proposed method to distinguish from the previous models using a traditional centralized control method, such as direct load control. A scenario-decomposition-based approach is then developed to solve the proposed robust SCOPF problem. Numerical simulations on IEEE 14- and IEEE 118-bus systems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Preventive control (PC) and corrective control (CC) are complementary actions in protecting large power systems against the risk of blackout. This paper addresses the optimal coordination between PC and CC via a preventive-corrective security-constrained optimal power flow model. The objective is to minimize the total expected-security-control cost which is the sum of the costs of PC and CC considering the probability of the contingencies. The constraints include system operating limits in pre-and post-contingency states, the existence of the post-contingency short-term equilibrium, and the coupling constraints on the CC actions. To solve the model, a hybrid computational strategy combining evolutionary algorithm and interior-point method is developed. The solution process consists of globally searching the critical feasible region and locally optimizing the operating variables in the found region, the two procedures interact iteratively to progressively tighten the solution region leading to the final solution. The proposed model and computational strategy are demonstrated on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems. To speed up the computation, parallel processing of the approach is implemented. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {With the increasing integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) in the power grid, a decentralized approach becomes essential for scheduling and allocation of resources in a smart grid. Economic Dispatch (ED) and Unit Commitment (UC) are the two major resource allocation problems that play critical role in the safe and stable operation of a grid system. The uncertainty associated with renewable energy sources have made the resource allocation problems even more challenging for grid operators. The future grid will have a higher generation mix of renewable energy sources and a large load of Electrical vehicles, with the possibility of bi-directional power flow. This complex smart grid system necessitates the development of a decentralized approach to resource allocation problem, which allows inter-node communication and decision making. Multi-agent systems (MAS) is a promising platform to decentralize the traditional centralized resource allocation aspects of smart grid. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on the application of MAS to Economic Dispatch (ED) and Unit Commitment (UC) in smart grids.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new paradigm for solving AC Power Flow (ACPF) and AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) with improved convergence robustness. This approach exploits the globally convergent properties of continuation methods. Continuation methods achieve robustness by generating a sequence of nonlinear problems and repeatedly and consistently providing good initial guesses for locally convergent nonlinear solvers such as Newton-Raphson. The Homotopy implemented in this paper, (referred to as Power Flow Homotopy, PFH), is formulated in a way that gradually transforms the easy DC into the difficult AC Power Flow. Successive changes of the homotopy parameter modify the system of equations from fully linear and convex DC into non-linear and non-convex AC (optimal) power flow. As a result, the AC solution is obtained with increased robustness and multiple AC power flow solutions can also be detected. Similarly, Optimal Power Flow Homotopy (OPFH) is defined for solving AC Optimal Power Flow, by gradually transforming the convex DC OPF problem. Simulation results provide a comparison between the simple Newton-Raphson method and PFH in terms of performance and quality of detected solution. Comparisons are also performed between the Interior-Point method and OPFH. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Higher shares of electricity generation from renewable energy sources and market liberalization is increasing uncertainty in power systems operation. At the same time, operation is becoming more flexible with improved control systems and new technology such as phase shifting transformers (PSTs) and high voltage direct current connections (HVDC). Previous studies have shown that the use of corrective control in response to outages contributes to a reduction in operating cost, while maintaining N-1 security. In this work, we propose a method to extend the use of corrective control of PSTs and HVDCs to react to uncertainty. We characterize the uncertainty as continuous random variables, and define the corrective control actions through affine control policies. This allows us to efficiently model control reactions to a large number of uncertainty sources. The control policies are then included in a chance constrained optimal power flow formulation, which guarantees that the system constraints are enforced with a desired probability. By applying an analytical reformulation of the chance constraints, we obtain a second-order cone problem for which we develop an efficient solution algorithm. In a case study for the IEEE 118 bus system, we show that corrective control for uncertainty leads to a decrease in operational cost, while maintaining system security. Further, we demonstrate the scalability of the method by solving the problem for the IEEE 300 bus and the Polish system test cases.},

abstract = {The ACOPF is at the core of competitive wholesale electricity markets and vertically integrated utility operations. The ACOPF simultaneously co-optimizes real and reactive power. First formulated over half a century ago in 1962 by Carpentier, the ACOPF is the most representative mathematical programming-based formulation of steady-state operations in AC networks. However the ACOPF is not solved in practice due to the nonconvex, nonlinear structure of the problem, for which finding the globally optimal solution is known to be NP-hard. Instead, least-cost unit commitment and generation dispatch in the day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time markets is determined with numerous simplifications of the ACOPF. This work presents a series of essays on the ACOPF problem, which include formulations, approximations, and applications in the electricity markets. The main themes center around ACOPF modeling fundamentals, followed by local and global solution methods to solve the problem for a variety of applications in the electricity markets. Original contributions of these essays include an alternative formulation of the ACOPF, a successive linear programming algorithm to solving the ACOPF for the real-time market, an outer approximation method to solving integrated ACOPF-unit commitment as a mixed-integer linear program for the day-ahead market, and applications of convex relaxations to the ACOPF and its approximations for the purpose of globally optimal storage integration. These contributions are concluded with a discussion of potential future directions of work.},

abstract = {The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is a fundamental building block for the optimization of electrical power systems. It is nonlinear and nonconvex and computes the generator setpoints for power and voltage, given a set of load demands. It is often needed to be solved repeatedly under various conditions, either in real-time or in large-scale studies. This need is further exacerbated by the increasing stochasticity of power systems due to renewable energy sources in front and behind the meter. To address these challenges, this paper presents a deep learning approach to the OPF. The learning model exploits the information available in the prior states of the system (which is commonly available in practical applications), as well as a dual Lagrangian method to satisfy the physical and engineering constraints present in the OPF. The proposed model is evaluated on a large collection of realistic power systems. The experimental results show that its predictions are highly accurate with average errors as low as 0.2%. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to improve the accuracy of widely adopted OPF linear DC approximation by at least two orders of magnitude.},

A computationally more affordable convex reformulation is developed by resorting to suitable linear approximations of the AC power-flow equations as well as convex approximations of the chance constraints. The approximate chance constraints provide conservative bounds that hold for arbitrary distributions of the forecasting errors.

The system security is controlled through an overall system risk constraint, which accumulates the individual risk related to each contingency, defined as the product between the probability of contingency occurrence and the contingency severity. The latter is expressed in terms of the amount of voluntary load shedding which, complementary to conventional corrective actions, is able to correct violation of post-contingency long-term thermal limits. The existing RB-SCOPF formulations are enhanced with short-term thermal post-contingency limits, aimed at avoiding cascade line tripping, and TSO operating rule.

In traditional power flow, the voltage magnitude and phase angle at each bus are treated as the independent variables. In the LFB model, the real and reactive power flows through the line along with the bus voltage magnitudes constitute the independent variables. The formulation is done by decoupling the OPF problem into active power and reactive power subproblems using line flow equations. Unlike traditional decomposition methods, the technique adopted in this approach does not ignore the weak coupling between the subjacobians.

abstract = {This paper describes a method for computing the optimal balance between preventive and corrective security actions. This method relies on a three-stage Benders decomposition and is capable of handling the mixed integer linear nature of this problem. A number of cases studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and to illustrate the consequences of introducing demand side corrective actions. In particular, it is shown that using corrective actions can significantly reduce the total cost of security and that the reliability of the transmission system affects the optimal mix of preventive and corrective security. The proposed method provides a basis for negotiations between the transmission operator and potential providers of demand side corrective actions.},

abstract = {High penetration of renewable energy sources and the increasing share of stochastic loads require the explicit representation of uncertainty in tools such as the optimal power flow (OPF). Current approaches follow either a linearized approach or an iterative approximation of nonlinearities. This paper proposes a semidefinite relaxation of a chance-constrained AC-OPF, which is able to provide guarantees for global optimality. Using a piecewise affine policy, we can ensure tractability, accurately model large power deviations, and determine suitable corrective control policies for active power, reactive power, and voltage. We state a tractable formulation for two types of uncertainty sets. Using a scenario-based approach and making no prior assumptions about the probability distribution of the forecast errors, we obtain a robust formulation for a rectangular uncertainty set. Alternatively, assuming a Gaussian distribution of the forecast errors, we propose an analytical reformulation of the chance constraints suitable for semidefinite programming. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the IEEE 24 and 118 bus system using realistic day-Ahead forecast data and obtain tight near-global optimality guarantees.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on distribution systems featuring renewable energy sources and energy storage devices, and develops an optimal power flow (OPF) approach to optimize the system operation in spite of forecasting errors. The proposed method builds on a chance-constrained multi-period AC OPF formulation, where probabilistic constraints are utilized to enforce voltage regulation with a prescribed probability. To enable a computationally affordable solution approach, a convex reformulation of the OPF task is obtained by resorting to i) suitable linear approximations of the power flow equations, and ii) convex approximations of the chance constraints. Particularly, the approximate chance constraints provide conservative bounds that hold for arbitrary distributions of the forecasting errors. An adaptive optimization strategy is then obtained by embedding the proposed OPF task into a model predictive control framework.},

@article{Park2019,
abstract = {Realistic representations of contingencies in AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) often challenge traditional bus-branch network models. Derived from nodal analysis, such approaches represent network constraints in terms of the familiar bus admittance matrix, Ybus. A fixed Ybus is unable to represent common circuit breaker actions such as bus splitting. Work-arounds for Ybus-based analysis typically rely on topology processing, switching between different Ybus matrices depending on breaker settings. In this paper, we propose a very general node-breaker approach, employing multi-port element models and using a sparse tableau formulation (STF) for network constraints. Instead of treating breaker action as altering network topology, and hence changing the structure of Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) and Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) equations, this approach represents a breaker's position as impacting only constraints associated with a single component, thereby maintaining fixed structure in the KVL and KCL constraints. While larger numbers of variables are required, STF proves sparser than Ybus formulations. Numerical case studies herein demonstrate that STF provides computational efficiency comparable to a Ybus-based ACOPF at the scale of several hundred buses, and lower computational cost in an example of over one thousand buses.},

The design of the distributed control algorithm is based on suitable linear approximation of the ac power-flow equations, and leverages the so-called alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Convergence of the RES-inverter output powers to solutions of the approximate ac OPF problem is established under suitable conditions on the mismatches between the commanded setpoints and actual RES output powers. Overall, since the proposed scheme can be cast as an ADMM with inexact primal and dual updates, the convergence results can be applied to more general distributed optimization settings.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to determine the optimal daily generation scheduling based on the Spanish electricity market rules. The Spanish power system considers the pool-based daily market and the technical constraints resolution as two different and consecutive processes. After the daily market has been cleared, a centralized constraints resolution process is applied to this initial scheduling through the redispatch of previously matched energy. In this paper, an algorithm based on Benders decomposition, arranged in three levels, is proposed to solve the technical constraints solution process in order to define a preventive secure dispatch. The constraints resolution process includes a full ac network and security model. This method determines the active power committed to each generating unit so as to minimize the energy redispatch cost subject to dispatch, network, and security constraints. The solution also provides the reactive power output of the generating units, the value of the transformers taps, and the committed voltage control devices. The model has been tested in an actual example of the Spanish power system. Some relevant results are reported. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

This work presents an overview of some of the uses to which a tailored AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) can be applied to DG planning and optimisation. Its application to maximising connectable capacity and energy loss minimisation are presented and discussed. The incorporation of a wide range of network constraints, including fault levels, voltage step change and N-1 security are also outlined. The AC OPF technique is extended to a multi-period approach to cater for the variability of demand and renewable generation. Advanced smart grid-like control strategies are also incorporated into this planning tool in order to evaluate the potential benefits. Simple test feeders as well as generic UK distribution systems are adopted to demonstrate the methodology. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The set of optimization problems in electric power systems engineering known collectively as Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is one of the most practically important and well-researched subfields of constrained nonlinear optimization. OPF has enjoyed a rich history of research, innovation, and publication since its debut five decades ago. Nevertheless, entry into OPF research is a daunting task for the uninitiated—both due to the sheer volume of literature and because OPF's familiarity within the electric power systems community has led authors to assume a great deal of prior knowledge that readers unfamiliar with electric power systems may not possess. This primer provides a practical introduction to OPF from an Operations Research perspective; it describes a complete and concise basis of knowledge for beginning OPF research. The primer is tailored for the Operations Researcher who has experience with optimization but little knowledge of Electrical Engi- neering. Topics include power systems modeling, the power flow equations, typical OPF formulations, and data exchange for OPF.},
